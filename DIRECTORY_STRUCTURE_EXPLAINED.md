# Project Directory Structure Explained

## Overview

This document outlines the directory structure used in this project and provides an explanation for the purpose of each folder. The structure is designed to promote clarity, scalability, and adherence to best practices in software architecture, with a strong emphasis on **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** and **modular, layered architecture**.

By organizing the codebase and documentation in a logical and layered manner, we enable cross-functional collaboration, ease of navigation, and efficient development workflows. Each directory reflects a specific concern or layer in the system, helping to separate responsibilities and minimize coupling between components.

## Motivation

The primary goals of this structure are:

- **Clarity**: Developers, designers, and stakeholders can easily locate and understand relevant parts of the project.
- **Scalability**: As the system grows, this modular structure allows independent evolution of components.
- **Separation of concerns**: Clear boundaries between business logic, infrastructure, UI, and documentation.
- **Consistency**: A unified layout across modules reduces the learning curve for new contributors.
- **Documentation-first development**: The inclusion of comprehensive documentation directories supports analysis, traceability, and maintainability.

## Intended Audience

This structure serves a variety of stakeholders throughout the development lifecycle:

- **Developers**: To implement, test, and maintain business logic and supporting infrastructure.
- **Architects**: To document, validate, and evolve the systemâ€™s architecture and design.
- **Product Owners and Analysts**: To collaborate on requirements, feasibility studies, and use cases.
- **UI/UX Designers**: To manage visual assets, wireframes, and interface specifications.
- **DevOps/Infra Teams**: To manage deployment, containerization, and environment configuration.
- **Quality Assurance Teams**: To organize test cases and validation scenarios.

## How to Use This Document

Use this document as a reference when navigating the project, onboarding new contributors, or proposing new components or changes to the structure. If you need to introduce a new directory, follow the naming conventions and placement principles outlined here.

## Evolution and Flexibility

While this structure is comprehensive, it is not rigid. As the system evolves, this layout can be extended or refined to fit new domains, tools, or workflows. Provided changes must be consistent with the overall architecture philosophy.

## Directory Reference Table

The table below provides a detailed explanation of each directory:
