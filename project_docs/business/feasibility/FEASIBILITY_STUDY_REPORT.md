# Feasibility Study Report


## Introduction



### Purpose of the Feasibility Study

> Clearly state that the objective of this report is to assess the viability of developing an open-source Learning Management System (LMS) specifically for public schools globally, undertaken as a personal side project.

The primary objective of this report is to assess the viability of developing an open-source Learning Management System (LMS), specifically designed for implementation in public schools worldwide, as part of an independently developed personal project.



### Scope of the Study

> Define the boundaries of the investigation. This should include assessing the organizational needs of public schools for an LMS, the technical feasibility of using open-source technologies for development, the integration challenges with potentially diverse school systems, and the feasibility of completing this project within the constraints of a personal, side endeavor. It's important to acknowledge that the scope might be limited by available time and resources.



### Background

> Briefly describe the context of the proposed system. Highlight the potential benefits of an open-source LMS for public schools, such as accessibility, cost-effectiveness, customizability, and the opportunity to address specific educational needs. Mention your personal motivation to contribute to open software for public education.


## System Goals and Objectives



### Contribution to Organizational Objectives (Public Schools)

> Detail how the proposed open-source LMS aligns with and contributes to the broader goals and strategic objectives of public education worldwide. This might include improving access to educational resources, facilitating online learning, supporting diverse pedagogical approaches, and potentially reducing costs associated with proprietary LMS solutions. Emphasize that this is your intended contribution as a developer. According to Sommerville, a feasibility study should answer if the system contributes to the overall objectives of the organization. In this case, the 'organization' is the global public education sector.



### Specific System Objectives

> Outline the intended outcomes and benefits of the LMS if implemented. These could include providing features for content delivery, assessment, communication, collaboration, and user management, all within an open and adaptable framework.


## Technical Feasibility



### Assessment of Current Technology

> Analyze whether the system can be implemented using current and available open-source technology. This should consider open-source programming languages, frameworks, databases, and deployment options. Given the nature of an open-source project, leveraging existing mature open-source components and libraries should be a key consideration. As Sommerville notes, software reuse is very important.



### Potential Technical Challenges

> Identify any potential technical risks or challenges associated with the system's development and implementation as a personal project. These could include the complexity of building a comprehensive LMS, ensuring scalability and security, managing contributions from other developers (if the project grows), and providing adequate documentation and support.


## Economic Feasibility



### Cost-Benefit Analysis

> Provide a preliminary assessment of the costs associated with developing, implementing, and maintaining the system, weighed against the potential benefits. For a personal open-source project, the primary 'cost' will likely be your time and effort, as well as potentially the cost of hosting and infrastructure. The benefits are the potential positive impact on public education. Traditional monetary cost-benefit analysis might be less relevant than assessing the value and sustainability of your contribution. This directly addresses the budgetary aspect of a key feasibility question.



### Budgetary Constraints

> Clearly state the budgetary limitations of this being a personal side project. This will influence the scope and timeline of the development.


## Schedule Feasibility



### Preliminary Project Timeline

> Outline a high-level estimated timeline for the system's development and potential deployment, keeping in mind that this is a part-time personal endeavor. An incremental development approach, as mentioned by Sommerville in the context of large systems, might be a feasible strategy. Agile software development methods could also be considered for managing the development in iterations. This addresses the scheduling aspect of a key feasibility question.



### Potential Schedule Risks

> Identify any factors that could potentially delay the project timeline, such as personal commitments, technical hurdles, or the learning curve associated with new technologies.


## Integration Feasibility



### Compatibility with Existing Systems

> When evaluating the ability of the proposed open-source LMS to integrate with other systems currently used in public schools globally, the report must acknowledge the vast diversity of existing technologies and infrastructure. As a personal side project, deep, comprehensive integration with all possible systems will likely be infeasible initially. The study should identify common types of systems found in public schools (e.g., student information systems, content repositories) and perhaps prioritize integration with a few key, widely used open standards or systems, if any exist. The report should highlight that achieving broad integration will likely be an ongoing effort, potentially involving community contributions if the project gains traction.



### Data Migration and Interoperability

> The feasibility study needs to address the significant challenges of data migration and ensuring interoperability across different school systems. Given that this is a personal project, developing comprehensive data migration tools for a multitude of proprietary systems would be a major undertaking. The report should consider suggesting a focus on supporting open data standards and providing clear guidelines or tools for schools to migrate their data, potentially requiring technical expertise at the school level. Interoperability might be achieved through adherence to open standards or APIs where available, but the study should be realistic about the limitations of what can be personally developed.


## Alternatives Considered

> Briefly discuss any alternative solutions or approaches that were considered and the reasons for focusing on the proposed system.


## Recommendations and Conclusion



### Summary of Findings

> The summary should clearly reiterate the findings related to the technical feasibility of using open-source technologies, the economic feasibility (primarily focusing on the time commitment of a personal project), the schedule feasibility of a side endeavor, and critically, the potential challenges in integration and interoperability within the diverse landscape of global public schools.



### Overall Feasibility Assessment

> The overall assessment must be realistic given the personal nature of the project and the ambitious goal of serving global public schools. It should explicitly answer the three key questions:




#### Does the system contribute to the overall objectives of the organization (global public schools)?

> The report should argue that an open-source LMS can indeed contribute by increasing access, affordability, and customizability in education.




#### Can the system be implemented within schedule and budget (personal time and resources) using current technology (open-source)?

> This needs a cautious assessment. The report should likely recommend starting with a narrow scope and core functionalities to make the project manageable as a side endeavor.




#### Can the system be integrated with other systems that are used (various school systems)?

> The conclusion should acknowledge the complexity and state that full, seamless integration across all systems is unlikely to be achievable by a single individual in the initial phases. A phased approach focusing on standards and potentially community-driven integration efforts might be suggested.



### Recommendations

> The recommendations should be practical and aligned with the primary motive:
> - **Start with a focused set of core LMS features** that address fundamental needs in public education.
> - **Prioritize a modular and extensible architecture** from the outset to facilitate future integration and community contributions.
> - **Emphasize open standards and interoperability** where possible in the initial design.
> - **Consider a phased rollout strategy**, perhaps starting with a pilot program in a limited number of schools or focusing on a specific region.
> - **Actively engage with the open-source community** from the beginning to seek feedback, contributions, and potentially collaborators.
> - **Provide clear and comprehensive documentation** to facilitate adoption and community involvement.
