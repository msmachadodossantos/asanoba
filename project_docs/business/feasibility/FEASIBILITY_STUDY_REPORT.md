#### Technical feasibility of using open-source technologies for development

The implementation of a Learning Management System (LMS) for educational purposes frequently involves prominent platforms such as Moodle, Sakai, and Canvas, all widely recognized for their advanced features and broad institutional adoption. However, despite their established capabilities, these systems may present challenges related to user interface and operational complexity, which can potentially hinder accessibility and effectiveness for various user profiles.

Moodle, as an open-source LMS, benefits from the support of a vast global community and offers a comprehensive range of functionalities. Successive updates to the platform incorporate continuous improvements to the interface, demonstrating a consistent effort to enhance usability. Additionally, the Moodle community provides free support through specialized forums on Moodle.org, reinforcing the notion of a constantly evolving system with significant potential. It is also important to note that educational institutions may adopt open-source systems as a means of adapting to their specific contextual needs. This type of system allows for the extension of functionalities through the use of community-developed plugins, and the presence of technical expertise in Information Technology within most university environments significantly contributes to its technical viability. Although Moodle is generally regarded as a stable platform, its open nature implies that customization—while offering high flexibility—can prove complex and require specialized skills, which, if not managed carefully, may result in usability issues. Nevertheless, this very flexibility, inherent to open-source systems, offers viable alternatives for users across diverse settings, allowing institutions to tailor the platform to their specific requirements. The technical feasibility of development based on open technologies is further reinforced by the ability to extend existing functionalities and incorporate community plugins, which can be directed toward improving the user interface.

Canvas is another leading LMS platform, frequently selected by institutions that prioritize a modern and intuitive user experience. Despite this design focus, migration to Canvas reveals, in practice, the presence of a substantial learning process, as evidenced by the considerable allocation of human resources for course adaptation and faculty training. This scenario suggests that even a platform designed for intuitiveness may entail complexities that require adequate preparation in order for its full potential to be realized.

A general challenge across LMS platforms, applicable to both Moodle and Canvas, concerns the possibility of difficult navigation and a non-intuitive design, which can lead to frustration among faculty and students and, consequently, result in low adoption rates. Furthermore, in educational settings, users frequently encounter non-standard terminology and unfamiliar acronyms within the LMS environment, hindering comprehension and effective system navigation.

Despite the aforementioned interface challenges, the viability of using open-source technologies for LMS development lies in their adaptability and evolution driven by a community of users and developers. The flexibility characteristic of open systems allows institutions to adjust the user interface and implement specific functionalities in order to meet the needs of their user base. While this process may require specialized technical knowledge, the solid presence of IT expertise in many academic settings further strengthens this viability. In addition, the potentially lower cost of open-source solutions enables financial resources to be redirected toward initiatives aimed at improving usability and technical support. The open nature of these technologies also facilitates integration with other applications and external resources, thus expanding the possibilities for enhancing the user experience.

In summary, although Moodle and Canvas offer significant benefits and are widely used in educational contexts, the challenges associated with their user interfaces and the complexity resulting from their extensive features may negatively impact the experience of various users. Nevertheless, Moodle’s open-source nature presents a concrete technical feasibility for addressing such usability issues through customization, flexibility, and ongoing community support, positioning it as a technically adaptable and effective solution for the development of learning management platforms tailored to institutional needs.




#### The integration challenges with potentially diverse school systems

A significant aspect of implementing and managing Learning Management Systems (LMS) in educational settings involves the challenges of integrating these systems with potentially diverse existing school infrastructures and technologies. Several key difficulties arise when attempting to integrate an LMS into the complex ecosystem of a school or institution.

One major challenge stems from compatibility issues between different systems. Schools often utilize a variety of software tools for tasks such as attendance tracking, gradebooks, and communication. An LMS might not be designed to work seamlessly with these pre-existing systems due to differences in programming languages, file formats, and technical requirements. This incompatibility can lead to data loss, system crashes, and other technical problems. Integrating an LMS with other tools can be challenging due to the different programming languages and file formats, and organizations need to ensure the LMS is compatible with all the tools used.

Furthermore, a lack of standardization in data formats and protocols exacerbates these compatibility issues. Different software applications might use varying standards for data exchange and communication, making it difficult to integrate them with an LMS and potentially leading to data inconsistencies and errors. To overcome this, organizations should look for LMS solutions that support industry-standard interoperability protocols like SCORM and AICC or utilize APIs for smoother communication between applications.

Data integration itself presents a substantial hurdle. Connecting an LMS with other school systems, such as Student Information Systems (SIS) or HR platforms, requires a seamless flow of data. However, data in each system may be stored in different formats, use different terminologies, or have different structures. This can create data silos, hindering a holistic view of learner progress and making reporting cumbersome. As Learn Leap Consultants point out, data integration involves creating a seamless flow of data between the LMS and other systems, which can be challenging because data may be stored in different formats or have different structures.

System complexity and technical constraints also contribute to integration challenges. Different systems within a school might have varying architectures, infrastructures, or software versions, making the integration process technically complex. Incompatible APIs or software dependencies can further pose hurdles. This often necessitates a high level of technical expertise and may even require the development of custom code, making the process time-consuming and resource-intensive.

The existence of legacy systems within schools can also complicate integration efforts. These older systems might lack the necessary APIs or compatibility features to integrate with modern LMS platforms, requiring significant workarounds or even system upgrades. The New York City Department of Education's experience in 2021 highlights this, where the diverse systems in place across their schools led to significant integration challenges when attempting to deploy new educational technologies.

Moreover, onboarding schools to a new integrated system can be challenging. Convincing school IT administrators to complete the integration is often a difficult task, as many data integrations are not straightforward and can be time-consuming for IT staff. If the integration process is not user-friendly for administrators, it can cause delays in adoption.

Finally, the choice of LMS itself significantly impacts the ease of integration. Selecting an LMS that offers seamless integration capabilities with the school's existing software is crucial for streamlining workflows and reducing data inconsistencies. Working with IT teams to identify necessary integrations and ensuring data can flow between systems without issues is a vital step.

In conclusion, integrating an LMS with the potentially diverse range of systems within a school environment presents numerous technical and logistical challenges. Addressing these requires careful planning, a thorough understanding of existing systems, the selection of compatible LMS solutions, and a focus on ensuring data interoperability and a user-friendly integration process. Leveraging standardized protocols like APIs can also help to mitigate these challenges.




#### The feasibility of completing this project within the constraints of a personal, side endeavor

This section analyzes the feasibility of developing a functional, open source Learning Management System (LMS) as a side endeavor, led by a single developer operating with limited time and resources.





##### Technical Scope and Approach

The project encompasses key LMS functionalities such as user management, course creation, file handling, and basic assessment tools. To maximize control over the codebase and reduce long-term dependency risks, the system will be developed using vanilla PHP, JavaScript, and CSS, with no reliance on external frameworks, ORMs, or libraries. This decision prioritizes simplicity and maintainability by eliminating versioning conflicts and reducing exposure to upstream breaking changes commonly introduced in third-party tools.

For context, widely adopted frameworks such as Laravel, Django, and Node.js (often combined with React or Vue.js) offer significant productivity gains and rich ecosystems. However, their adoption requires ongoing tracking of updates, compatibility layers, and a steeper maintenance burden—factors considered unsustainable within the constraints of an individual, time-limited contributor.





##### Time and Resource Constraints

The development will occur outside regular business hours and is dependent on the availability and consistency of a single contributor. This inherently limits the development velocity and imposes a high risk of delays, especially in the absence of collaborative support structures.

To mitigate this, the project will follow an incremental delivery strategy, starting with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) focusing on core features only. This approach allows for early validation, prioritization of essential components, and manageable scope evolution over time.





##### Open Source Considerations

By releasing the project under an open source license, there is potential for gradual community adoption and contribution, which could offset some long-term maintenance challenges. While initial development will be isolated, future engagement from other developers may help expand functionality and improve code quality.

#### A Personal Commitment to Educational Equity

LMS platforms are not only strategic tools for modern education; they are essential for fostering equitable, inclusive, and innovative learning environments. In public schools, open-source systems provide a powerful alternative that supports both access and customization.

As a web developer whose educational journey largely unfolded within the public school system, I have a first-hand understanding of the barriers many Brazilian students face in accessing quality education. My path has been shaped by the support of family, friends, and collaborative communities, including the Catholic University where I had the privilege to further develop my skills. These experiences have deeply influenced my perspective on the transformative power of technology in supporting those who champion educational equity.

My involvement in this project stems not only from technical or professional interests but also from a personal commitment to the democratization of knowledge. I believe that developing accessible and open digital tools can be a powerful driver of inclusion, offering pedagogical support, interactive resources, and learning opportunities for students who often lack adequate infrastructure or specialized assistance. Each phase of this project reflects an ongoing process of refinement, with a constant drive to improve how technology can foster educational equity.


## System Goals and Objectives



### Contribution to Organizational Objectives (Public Schools)

> Detail how the proposed open-source LMS aligns with and contributes to the broader goals and strategic objectives of public education worldwide. This might include improving access to educational resources, facilitating online learning, supporting diverse pedagogical approaches, and potentially reducing costs associated with proprietary LMS solutions. Emphasize that this is your intended contribution as a developer. According to Sommerville, a feasibility study should answer if the system contributes to the overall objectives of the organization. In this case, the 'organization' is the global public education sector.

A feasibility study should determine whether a given system aligns with and contributes to the overarching objectives of the relevant organization. In the context of this open-source learning management system (LMS), to which I intend to contribute as a developer, the term “organization” pertains to the global public education sector.

The strategic objectives of global public education encompass several fundamental dimensions. Chief among these is the commitment to ensuring quality, inclusive, and equitable education, while promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all individuals. This core principle underpins Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG 4), coordinated by UNESCO. Education is universally recognized as a fundamental human right with far-reaching implications for individual and collective well-being. The overarching aim is to guarantee equitable access to education at all levels—including primary, secondary, vocational, and tertiary education; while addressing and eliminating disparities linked to gender, socioeconomic status, and social or geographic background. These educational pathways may encompass formal, non-formal, and informal learning, often supported by information and communication technologies (ICT). Addressing systemic barriers to access, such as poverty, armed conflict, natural disasters, and gender inequality, remains imperative.

In this context, the proposed open-source LMS represents a direct contribution to enhancing access, scalability, and equity in education. As a freely available and customizable digital platform, it offers a cost-effective alternative to proprietary LMS solutions, thereby reducing financial barriers for educational institutions, particularly in low-resource settings. Its open-source nature also fosters collaborative innovation, enabling local adaptation and long-term sustainability.

Education also serves as a catalyst for sustainable development and is integral to the attainment of the remaining Sustainable Development Goals. As a foundational pillar of global progress, Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) seeks to empower learners with the knowledge, skills, values, and dispositions necessary to support and advance the SDGs. In this context, ESD promotes the development of cross-cutting competencies for sustainability, which are applicable across all goals. These competencies encompass cognitive (knowledge and critical thinking), socio-emotional (values and attitudes), and behavioral dimensions, equipping learners to effectively navigate and address the specific challenges posed by each goal. A robust LMS can facilitate this development by hosting diverse, interdisciplinary learning content aligned with ESD principles and by enabling interactive, learner-centered pedagogical models.

Another key objective of global public education is to enhance equitable access to educational resources, ensuring that no one is left behind. This entails the implementation of free and compulsory basic education; particularly at the primary and secondary levels; and the elimination of disparities in access and learning outcomes. These disparities are frequently influenced by gender, economic background, and geographic isolation. Adequate investment in basic educational infrastructure is a prerequisite for achieving this objective. Concurrently, digital transformation has emerged as a pivotal strategy for improving accessibility, quality, and learner engagement. In this regard, the integration of a scalable and inclusive open-source LMS can play a critical role by expanding access to quality educational resources, supporting remote and blended learning modalities, and enabling consistent delivery across diverse geographic and socio-economic contexts.

The integration of digital tools in education necessitates investment in inclusive and accessible digital infrastructure, the cultivation of digital and data literacy, and the deployment of e-learning platforms and virtual classrooms. The proposed open-source LMS directly supports these efforts by offering a flexible, adaptable, and multilingual framework that can be customized to meet local educational needs and align with national curricula. Strategic planning is essential to facilitate the seamless and effective integration of such technologies into national education systems.

Contemporary public education must transcend traditional pedagogical models and foster critical awareness of the complex challenges facing today’s societies. This transformation requires the adoption of innovative instructional methods, including collaborative learning, project-based approaches, and the strategic use of digital technologies. A learner-centered approach that acknowledges prior knowledge and individual experience is indispensable. Transformative and action-oriented pedagogies are essential to fostering empowerment and intrinsic motivation among learners. An open-source LMS can support these methodologies by enabling interactive features, peer collaboration, and flexible content delivery. Moreover, curricular flexibility must be ensured to accommodate locally relevant content and community-based initiatives; an area where open-source systems excel due to their inherent adaptability.

Enhancing the quality of teaching constitutes another central strategic priority. This objective involves both increasing the number of qualified educators and enhancing their professional competencies, particularly through the integration of ESD principles into initial teacher preparation and ongoing professional development programs. Educators must acquire key sustainability competencies to implement these pedagogical innovations effectively. An LMS can support teacher development by providing structured professional learning environments, micro-credentialing systems, and access to global teaching resources. Continuous professional learning is vital to ensure that instructional practices remain relevant, evidence-based, and responsive to evolving societal demands.

Finally, public education systems must be aligned with national socioeconomic development priorities and international frameworks, including the SDGs and guidance documents such as the OECD’s Education 2030 Framework. Long-term strategic planning is critical to establishing coherent educational goals and ensuring that public education initiatives are responsive to societal needs and rooted in shared human values.

The emphasis on digital transformation and ICT integration underscores a global willingness to embrace diverse technological solutions, including cost-effective and scalable alternatives. Within this framework, the adoption of an open-source LMS is especially well-aligned with global priorities such as accessibility, inclusion, quality, innovation, and sustainable development. Its collaborative, flexible, and economically sustainable model offers a meaningful contribution to advancing the strategic goals of public education worldwide.

## Technical Feasibility



### Assessment of Current Technology

> Analyze whether the system can be implemented using current and available open-source technology. This should consider open-source programming languages, frameworks, databases, and deployment options. Given the nature of an open-source project, leveraging existing mature open-source components and libraries should be a key consideration. As Sommerville notes, software reuse is very important.



### Potential Technical Challenges

> Identify any potential technical risks or challenges associated with the system's development and implementation as a personal project. These could include the complexity of building a comprehensive LMS, ensuring scalability and security, managing contributions from other developers (if the project grows), and providing adequate documentation and support.


## Economic Feasibility



### Cost-Benefit Analysis

> Provide a preliminary assessment of the costs associated with developing, implementing, and maintaining the system, weighed against the potential benefits. For a personal open-source project, the primary 'cost' will likely be your time and effort, as well as potentially the cost of hosting and infrastructure. The benefits are the potential positive impact on public education. Traditional monetary cost-benefit analysis might be less relevant than assessing the value and sustainability of your contribution. This directly addresses the budgetary aspect of a key feasibility question.



### Budgetary Constraints

> Clearly state the budgetary limitations of this being a personal side project. This will influence the scope and timeline of the development.


## Schedule Feasibility



### Preliminary Project Timeline

> Outline a high-level estimated timeline for the system's development and potential deployment, keeping in mind that this is a part-time personal endeavor. An incremental development approach, as mentioned by Sommerville in the context of large systems, might be a feasible strategy. Agile software development methods could also be considered for managing the development in iterations. This addresses the scheduling aspect of a key feasibility question.



### Potential Schedule Risks

> Identify any factors that could potentially delay the project timeline, such as personal commitments, technical hurdles, or the learning curve associated with new technologies.


## Integration Feasibility



### Compatibility with Existing Systems

> When evaluating the ability of the proposed open-source LMS to integrate with other systems currently used in public schools globally, the report must acknowledge the vast diversity of existing technologies and infrastructure. As a personal side project, deep, comprehensive integration with all possible systems will likely be infeasible initially. The study should identify common types of systems found in public schools (e.g., student information systems, content repositories) and perhaps prioritize integration with a few key, widely used open standards or systems, if any exist. The report should highlight that achieving broad integration will likely be an ongoing effort, potentially involving community contributions if the project gains traction.



### Data Migration and Interoperability

> The feasibility study needs to address the significant challenges of data migration and ensuring interoperability across different school systems. Given that this is a personal project, developing comprehensive data migration tools for a multitude of proprietary systems would be a major undertaking. The report should consider suggesting a focus on supporting open data standards and providing clear guidelines or tools for schools to migrate their data, potentially requiring technical expertise at the school level. Interoperability might be achieved through adherence to open standards or APIs where available, but the study should be realistic about the limitations of what can be personally developed.


## Alternatives Considered

> Briefly discuss any alternative solutions or approaches that were considered and the reasons for focusing on the proposed system.


## Recommendations and Conclusion



### Summary of Findings

> The summary should clearly reiterate the findings related to the technical feasibility of using open-source technologies, the economic feasibility (primarily focusing on the time commitment of a personal project), the schedule feasibility of a side endeavor, and critically, the potential challenges in integration and interoperability within the diverse landscape of global public schools.



### Overall Feasibility Assessment

> The overall assessment must be realistic given the personal nature of the project and the ambitious goal of serving global public schools. It should explicitly answer the three key questions:




#### Does the system contribute to the overall objectives of the organization (global public schools)?

> The report should argue that an open-source LMS can indeed contribute by increasing access, affordability, and customizability in education.




#### Can the system be implemented within schedule and budget (personal time and resources) using current technology (open-source)?

> This needs a cautious assessment. The report should likely recommend starting with a narrow scope and core functionalities to make the project manageable as a side endeavor.




#### Can the system be integrated with other systems that are used (various school systems)?

> The conclusion should acknowledge the complexity and state that full, seamless integration across all systems is unlikely to be achievable by a single individual in the initial phases. A phased approach focusing on standards and potentially community-driven integration efforts might be suggested.



### Recommendations

> The recommendations should be practical and aligned with the primary motive:
> - Start with a focused set of core LMS features that address fundamental needs in public education.
>   - "Nobody should start to undertake a large project. You start with a small trivial project, and you should never expect it to get large. If you do, you'll just overdesign and generally think it is more important than it likely is at that stage. Or worse, you might be scared away by the sheer size of the work you envision. So start small, and think about the details. Don't think about some big picture and fancy design. If it doesn't solve some fairly immediate need, it's almost certainly over-designed. And don't expect people to jump in and help you. That's not how these things work. You need to get something half-way useful first, and then others will say "hey, that almost works for me", and they'll get involved in the project." - [Linus Torvalds](https://web.archive.org/web/20050404020308/http://www.linuxtimes.net/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=145)
> - Prioritize a modular and extensible architecture from the outset to facilitate future integration and community contributions.
> - Emphasize open standards and interoperability where possible in the initial design.
> - Consider a phased rollout strategy, perhaps starting with a pilot program in a limited number of schools or focusing on a specific region.
> - Actively engage with the open-source community from the beginning to seek feedback, contributions, and potentially collaborators.
> - Provide clear and comprehensive documentation to facilitate adoption and community involvement.
