The primary objective of this report is to assess the viability of developing an open-source Learning Management System (LMS), specifically designed for implementation in public schools worldwide, as part of an independently developed personal project.



### Scope of the Study

> Define the boundaries of the investigation. This should include assessing the organizational needs of public schools for an LMS, the technical feasibility of using open-source technologies for development, the integration challenges with potentially diverse school systems, and the feasibility of completing this project within the constraints of a personal, side endeavor. It's important to acknowledge that the scope might be limited by available time and resources.




#### Organizational needs of public schools for an LMS

Public schools face a range of organizational requirements when selecting, implementing, and managing a Learning Management System (LMS). These requirements encompass functional, technical, user support, strategic, and administrative dimensions. 

In terms of functionality and pedagogical support, the platform must not only reinforce the learning process in virtual environments but also offer effective means for distributing and supervising teaching materials, fostering discussions, planning activities, setting expectations, enabling personalized learning pathways, and supporting problem-solving. 

The LMS should allow for flexible pedagogical configurations based on constructivist principles and provide tools that enable teachers to customize learning experiences. It is essential that the system includes robust course management features, such as intuitive content uploading, clear categorization, and user-friendly navigation, while also supporting various content formats. It should facilitate the monitoring of results, attendance, assignments, and assessments, providing students with the tools needed to achieve their learning goals. 

Regarding technical and system requirements, the platform must be reliable, easy to use, scalable, and compatible with existing school systems, ensuring data integration and compliance with security and privacy standards, such as GDPR. 

User support and training constitute another key element, requiring continuous professional development for teachers, as well as training for students and parents, along with efficient technical support and accessible communication channels. 

Strategic alignment and planning involve selecting a system that reflects the goals of the school district, based on a participatory needs assessment and the development of a structured implementation and communication plan. 

Finally, with respect to administrative and financial considerations, it is important to assess not only the total cost of the platform but also to establish clear roles and responsibilities for its management, ensure adequate reporting capabilities, and guarantee that the system effectively supports the administrative aspects of teaching and learning. 

In summary, a suitable LMS for public schools must combine technological robustness, ease of use, pedagogical alignment, and administrative feasibility, fostering a consistent and effective learning experience for students while minimizing complexity and workload for teachers and families.




#### Technical feasibility of using open-source technologies for development

The implementation of a Learning Management System (LMS) for educational purposes frequently involves prominent platforms such as Moodle and Canvas, both widely recognized for their advanced features and broad institutional adoption. However, despite their established capabilities, these systems may present challenges related to user interface and operational complexity, which can potentially hinder accessibility and effectiveness for various user profiles.

Moodle, as an open-source LMS, benefits from the support of a vast global community and offers a comprehensive range of functionalities. Successive updates to the platform incorporate continuous improvements to the interface, demonstrating a consistent effort to enhance usability. Additionally, the Moodle community provides free support through specialized forums on Moodle.org, reinforcing the notion of a constantly evolving system with significant potential. It is also important to note that educational institutions may adopt open-source systems as a means of adapting to their specific contextual needs. This type of system allows for the extension of functionalities through the use of community-developed plugins, and the presence of technical expertise in Information Technology within most university environments significantly contributes to its technical viability. Although Moodle is generally regarded as a stable platform, its open nature implies that customization—while offering high flexibility—can prove complex and require specialized skills, which, if not managed carefully, may result in usability issues. Nevertheless, this very flexibility, inherent to open-source systems, offers viable alternatives for users across diverse settings, allowing institutions to tailor the platform to their specific requirements. The technical feasibility of development based on open technologies is further reinforced by the ability to extend existing functionalities and incorporate community plugins, which can be directed toward improving the user interface.

Canvas is another leading LMS platform, frequently selected by institutions that prioritize a modern and intuitive user experience. Despite this design focus, migration to Canvas reveals, in practice, the presence of a substantial learning process, as evidenced by the considerable allocation of human resources for course adaptation and faculty training. This scenario suggests that even a platform designed for intuitiveness may entail complexities that require adequate preparation in order for its full potential to be realized.

A general challenge across LMS platforms, applicable to both Moodle and Canvas, concerns the possibility of difficult navigation and a non-intuitive design, which can lead to frustration among faculty and students and, consequently, result in low adoption rates. Furthermore, in educational settings, users frequently encounter non-standard terminology and unfamiliar acronyms within the LMS environment, hindering comprehension and effective system navigation.

Despite the aforementioned interface challenges, the viability of using open-source technologies for LMS development lies in their adaptability and evolution driven by a community of users and developers. The flexibility characteristic of open systems allows institutions to adjust the user interface and implement specific functionalities in order to meet the needs of their user base. While this process may require specialized technical knowledge, the solid presence of IT expertise in many academic settings further strengthens this viability. In addition, the potentially lower cost of open-source solutions enables financial resources to be redirected toward initiatives aimed at improving usability and technical support. The open nature of these technologies also facilitates integration with other applications and external resources, thus expanding the possibilities for enhancing the user experience.

In summary, although Moodle and Canvas offer significant benefits and are widely used in educational contexts, the challenges associated with their user interfaces and the complexity resulting from their extensive features may negatively impact the experience of various users. Nevertheless, Moodle’s open-source nature presents a concrete technical feasibility for addressing such usability issues through customization, flexibility, and ongoing community support, positioning it as a technically adaptable and effective solution for the development of learning management platforms tailored to institutional needs.




#### The integration challenges with potentially diverse school systems

A significant aspect of implementing and managing Learning Management Systems (LMS) in educational settings involves the challenges of integrating these systems with potentially diverse existing school infrastructures and technologies. Several key difficulties arise when attempting to integrate an LMS into the complex ecosystem of a school or institution.

One major challenge stems from compatibility issues between different systems. Schools often utilize a variety of software tools for tasks such as attendance tracking, gradebooks, and communication. An LMS might not be designed to work seamlessly with these pre-existing systems due to differences in programming languages, file formats, and technical requirements. This incompatibility can lead to data loss, system crashes, and other technical problems. Integrating an LMS with other tools can be challenging due to the different programming languages and file formats, and organizations need to ensure the LMS is compatible with all the tools used.

Furthermore, a lack of standardization in data formats and protocols exacerbates these compatibility issues. Different software applications might use varying standards for data exchange and communication, making it difficult to integrate them with an LMS and potentially leading to data inconsistencies and errors. To overcome this, organizations should look for LMS solutions that support industry-standard interoperability protocols like SCORM and AICC or utilize APIs for smoother communication between applications.

Data integration itself presents a substantial hurdle. Connecting an LMS with other school systems, such as Student Information Systems (SIS) or HR platforms, requires a seamless flow of data. However, data in each system may be stored in different formats, use different terminologies, or have different structures. This can create data silos, hindering a holistic view of learner progress and making reporting cumbersome. As Learn Leap Consultants point out, data integration involves creating a seamless flow of data between the LMS and other systems, which can be challenging because data may be stored in different formats or have different structures.

System complexity and technical constraints also contribute to integration challenges. Different systems within a school might have varying architectures, infrastructures, or software versions, making the integration process technically complex. Incompatible APIs or software dependencies can further pose hurdles. This often necessitates a high level of technical expertise and may even require the development of custom code, making the process time-consuming and resource-intensive.

The existence of legacy systems within schools can also complicate integration efforts. These older systems might lack the necessary APIs or compatibility features to integrate with modern LMS platforms, requiring significant workarounds or even system upgrades. The New York City Department of Education's experience in 2021 highlights this, where the diverse systems in place across their schools led to significant integration challenges when attempting to deploy new educational technologies.

Moreover, onboarding schools to a new integrated system can be challenging. Convincing school IT administrators to complete the integration is often a difficult task, as many data integrations are not straightforward and can be time-consuming for IT staff. If the integration process is not user-friendly for administrators, it can cause delays in adoption.

Finally, the choice of LMS itself significantly impacts the ease of integration. Selecting an LMS that offers seamless integration capabilities with the school's existing software is crucial for streamlining workflows and reducing data inconsistencies. Working with IT teams to identify necessary integrations and ensuring data can flow between systems without issues is a vital step.

In conclusion, integrating an LMS with the potentially diverse range of systems within a school environment presents numerous technical and logistical challenges. Addressing these requires careful planning, a thorough understanding of existing systems, the selection of compatible LMS solutions, and a focus on ensuring data interoperability and a user-friendly integration process. Leveraging standardized protocols like APIs can also help to mitigate these challenges.




#### The feasibility of completing this project within the constraints of a personal, side endeavor

This section analyzes the feasibility of developing a functional, open source Learning Management System (LMS) as a side endeavor, led by a single developer operating with limited time and resources.





##### Technical Scope and Approach

The project encompasses key LMS functionalities such as user management, course creation, file handling, and basic assessment tools. To maximize control over the codebase and reduce long-term dependency risks, the system will be developed using vanilla PHP, JavaScript, and CSS, with no reliance on external frameworks, ORMs, or libraries. This decision prioritizes simplicity and maintainability by eliminating versioning conflicts and reducing exposure to upstream breaking changes commonly introduced in third-party tools.

For context, widely adopted frameworks such as Laravel, Django, and Node.js (often combined with React or Vue.js) offer significant productivity gains and rich ecosystems. However, their adoption requires ongoing tracking of updates, compatibility layers, and a steeper maintenance burden—factors considered unsustainable within the constraints of an individual, time-limited contributor.





##### Time and Resource Constraints

The development will occur outside regular business hours and is dependent on the availability and consistency of a single contributor. This inherently limits the development velocity and imposes a high risk of delays, especially in the absence of collaborative support structures.

To mitigate this, the project will follow an incremental delivery strategy, starting with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) focusing on core features only. This approach allows for early validation, prioritization of essential components, and manageable scope evolution over time.





##### Open Source Considerations

By releasing the project under an open source license, there is potential for gradual community adoption and contribution, which could offset some long-term maintenance challenges. While initial development will be isolated, future engagement from other developers may help expand functionality and improve code quality.





##### Risk Assessment

| Risk Factor                        | Mitigation Strategy                                                  |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Time constraints                   | Scope reduction; MVP-first approach                                  |
| Solo development effort            | Clear documentation; modular architecture                            |
| Lack of external libraries         | Increased initial development time accepted as trade-off             |
| No automated scalability tools     | Manual scaling provisions; targeted deployment scenarios             |





##### Conclusion

Given the outlined scope, chosen technical stack, and time constraints, the project is feasible at a minimal scale, provided that expectations are aligned with available capacity. A narrowly scoped MVP can realistically be achieved as a personal side project. However, expansion beyond the MVP stage will require careful prioritization or eventual external collaboration.

This might include improving access to educational resources, facilitating online learning, supporting diverse pedagogical approaches, and potentially reducing costs associated with proprietary LMS solutions. Emphasize that this is your intended contribution as a developer. According to Sommerville, a feasibility study should answer if the system contributes to the overall objectives of the organization. In this case, the 'organization' is the global public education sector.



### Specific System Objectives

> Outline the intended outcomes and benefits of the LMS if implemented. These could include providing features for content delivery, assessment, communication, collaboration, and user management, all within an open and adaptable framework.


## Technical Feasibility



### Assessment of Current Technology

> Analyze whether the system can be implemented using current and available open-source technology. This should consider open-source programming languages, frameworks, databases, and deployment options. Given the nature of an open-source project, leveraging existing mature open-source components and libraries should be a key consideration. As Sommerville notes, software reuse is very important.



### Potential Technical Challenges

> Identify any potential technical risks or challenges associated with the system's development and implementation as a personal project. These could include the complexity of building a comprehensive LMS, ensuring scalability and security, managing contributions from other developers (if the project grows), and providing adequate documentation and support.


## Economic Feasibility



### Cost-Benefit Analysis

> Provide a preliminary assessment of the costs associated with developing, implementing, and maintaining the system, weighed against the potential benefits. For a personal open-source project, the primary 'cost' will likely be your time and effort, as well as potentially the cost of hosting and infrastructure. The benefits are the potential positive impact on public education. Traditional monetary cost-benefit analysis might be less relevant than assessing the value and sustainability of your contribution. This directly addresses the budgetary aspect of a key feasibility question.



### Budgetary Constraints

> Clearly state the budgetary limitations of this being a personal side project. This will influence the scope and timeline of the development.


## Schedule Feasibility



### Preliminary Project Timeline

> Outline a high-level estimated timeline for the system's development and potential deployment, keeping in mind that this is a part-time personal endeavor. An incremental development approach, as mentioned by Sommerville in the context of large systems, might be a feasible strategy. Agile software development methods could also be considered for managing the development in iterations. This addresses the scheduling aspect of a key feasibility question.



### Potential Schedule Risks

> Identify any factors that could potentially delay the project timeline, such as personal commitments, technical hurdles, or the learning curve associated with new technologies.


## Integration Feasibility



### Compatibility with Existing Systems

> When evaluating the ability of the proposed open-source LMS to integrate with other systems currently used in public schools globally, the report must acknowledge the vast diversity of existing technologies and infrastructure. As a personal side project, deep, comprehensive integration with all possible systems will likely be infeasible initially. The study should identify common types of systems found in public schools (e.g., student information systems, content repositories) and perhaps prioritize integration with a few key, widely used open standards or systems, if any exist. The report should highlight that achieving broad integration will likely be an ongoing effort, potentially involving community contributions if the project gains traction.



### Data Migration and Interoperability

> The feasibility study needs to address the significant challenges of data migration and ensuring interoperability across different school systems. Given that this is a personal project, developing comprehensive data migration tools for a multitude of proprietary systems would be a major undertaking. The report should consider suggesting a focus on supporting open data standards and providing clear guidelines or tools for schools to migrate their data, potentially requiring technical expertise at the school level. Interoperability might be achieved through adherence to open standards or APIs where available, but the study should be realistic about the limitations of what can be personally developed.


## Alternatives Considered

> Briefly discuss any alternative solutions or approaches that were considered and the reasons for focusing on the proposed system.


## Recommendations and Conclusion



### Summary of Findings

> The summary should clearly reiterate the findings related to the technical feasibility of using open-source technologies, the economic feasibility (primarily focusing on the time commitment of a personal project), the schedule feasibility of a side endeavor, and critically, the potential challenges in integration and interoperability within the diverse landscape of global public schools.



### Overall Feasibility Assessment

> The overall assessment must be realistic given the personal nature of the project and the ambitious goal of serving global public schools. It should explicitly answer the three key questions:




#### Does the system contribute to the overall objectives of the organization (global public schools)?

> The report should argue that an open-source LMS can indeed contribute by increasing access, affordability, and customizability in education.




#### Can the system be implemented within schedule and budget (personal time and resources) using current technology (open-source)?

> This needs a cautious assessment. The report should likely recommend starting with a narrow scope and core functionalities to make the project manageable as a side endeavor.




#### Can the system be integrated with other systems that are used (various school systems)?

> The conclusion should acknowledge the complexity and state that full, seamless integration across all systems is unlikely to be achievable by a single individual in the initial phases. A phased approach focusing on standards and potentially community-driven integration efforts might be suggested.



### Recommendations

> The recommendations should be practical and aligned with the primary motive:
> - Start with a focused set of core LMS features that address fundamental needs in public education.
> - Prioritize a modular and extensible architecture from the outset to facilitate future integration and community contributions.
> - Emphasize open standards and interoperability where possible in the initial design.
> - Consider a phased rollout strategy, perhaps starting with a pilot program in a limited number of schools or focusing on a specific region.
> - Actively engage with the open-source community from the beginning to seek feedback, contributions, and potentially collaborators.
> - Provide clear and comprehensive documentation to facilitate adoption and community involvement.
